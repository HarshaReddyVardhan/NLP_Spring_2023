The installation process:

For completing the project I used jupyter Notebook.
First I have created the virtual environment in Anaconda.
The name of my virtual environment is tf-gpu.

1. First install jupyter notebook
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install required dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
